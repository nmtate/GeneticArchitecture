# Estimation of Genetic Architecture

Directories
- bayesR : houses bayesR, examples, etc.
- bayesR_new : updated version that allows for the use of covariates
- input_files : the code currently separates a bfile by chromosome and converts to bfile format which are housed here. This is also where the full file (after qc filtering) is stored here as a bfile.
- jobs : this directory stores the error and output files for each run, will be moved to scratch.global
- slurm.genearch : files necessary for snakemake
- trait_inputs : similar to the input files, but includes the trait information
